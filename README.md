# nn.c
Inspired by [Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy) and the elegant architecture of [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/), I have built this library to build deep neural nets in C. 
---
### NOTE
- The library is at its earliest stage
- I still need to figure out an architecture that will allow me to add things faster and easily in the future
- I'm actively working on the library to make it more efficient, add more features, and make to run **BLAZINGLY FAST**
- Find a better name of the project?
